This directory contains template files which can be used to enable automation on a Github repository.

Copy these files to the .github/ directory of your repository and then edit them to meet your needs.

The kosbuild.json file must be modified to remove the comments and customized for your build.  The workflow file
will likely need minimal customization, if any.

Once these files are committed to your repository, be sure to set the secrets on your repository.  Specifically, set:
KOSBUILD_SECRET_URL
and 
KOSBUILD_SECRET_PASSWORD
