Changes
-------

2025-April-14 : Removed the artifacts.marketplace option from build configuration.  Whether an artifact is published 
                to the market is driven by the artifactstore, not the artifact itself. In other words, the artifact
                store defines whether it holds marketplace artifacts.  If an artifact is published to an artifactstore
                which holds market artifacts, then the artifact is a market artifact.
